# SwiftDataExploration

A proof of concept for using the new SwiftData framework and the Codable protocol to make working with remote data a
little easier.

> Since this POC was written, SwiftData has come a long way and so has the documentation. Apple has added an offical guide for [persisting read-only data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/maintaining-a-local-copy-of-server-data) that is a much more complete example.

This is the follow-up to my previous post [CoreDataExploration](https://github.com/drewalth/CoreDataExploration) where
we experimented with vanilla CoreData and Codable.

# SwiftDataExploration

A proof of concept for using the new SwiftData framework and the Codable protocol to make working with remote data a

This is the follow-up to my previous post [CoreDataExploration](https://github.com/drewalth/CoreDataExploration) where
we experimented with vanilla CoreData and Codable.
